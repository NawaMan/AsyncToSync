AsyncToSync is a utility class that make it easy, convenient and declarative way to convert asynchronous operation to a
  synchronous one.
Of course, if you just need to make an asynchronous call synchronous, just call {@link Future#get()}.
There is no need for this class.

This class provide a declarative way to handle
- Timeout
- Exception from the asynchronous call
- Cancellation
- Interrupt from the asynchronous call
- Interrupt from the wait
- Run another asynchronous code (will be terminated after the main code completes) for something like
  - Conditional cancellation
  - Progress
